# Sustainify (HackUTD)
The ultimate advisor for greener, smarter, and more sustainable property management

## What It Does
Sustainify is a comprehensive tool built for property managers to help them make their buildings more sustainable and eco-friendly. Users upload their data on a variety of metrics directly on Sustainify, where it is processed and run through our AI models, trained to interpret resource data, optimize efficiency, and promote more economic decisions while driving sustainability. Users can then interact with our AI advisor and intuitive dashboard, enabling them to analyze their energy and resource usages, assess sustainability metrics, and receive actionable advice on how to improve their workflows. Key features include:

* **AI Advisor:** Personalized advisor that gives users suggestions to optimize their properties to be more sustainable and green
* **Usage Dashboard:** Intuitive dashboard visualizing usage data and trends
* **Sentiment Score:** Metrics are scored by comparing the user's data to the data of other similar buildings, providing insights into what they're doing well and what they need to improve
* **ML Prediction Model:** Predicts future usage projections with and without Sustainify's optimizations using a linear regression model trained on your data

## How We Built It
We built Sustainify using a powerful tech stack designed for efficiency and performance. **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Node.js** were used for a sleek, fully responsive, and dynamic frontend. We used **PostgreSQL** for data storage, **Pandas** for data processing, and **Scikit-learn** for machine learning, implementing a workflow to handle data effectively. We used **Chart.js** to visualize this data and build the dashboard, making complex insights easy to understand. **SambaNova API** powered the AI Advisor, enabling advanced natural language processing for tailored advice. **Flask** served as the backend framework with API endpoints to enable real-time communication between backend processes and the user interface.
